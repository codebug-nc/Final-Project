## Home Page Ideas

### Add a full-page [background image](https://github.com/codebug-nc/NCWD-3C#level-three):
- Find a cool image on a site that offers free stock photos: maybe [stocksnap](https://stocksnap.io/) or [unsplash](https://unsplash.com/)
- Search for "Background Image" on this page [https://www.w3schools.com/css/css_background.asp](https://www.w3schools.com/css/css_background.asp) to refresh your memory on implementations
- *HINT* you'll probably need `background-attachment: fixed;` if it's not spanning the whole page!
    
### Add a [parallax image](https://www.w3schools.com/howto/tryhow_css_parallax_demo.htm) to the background
