# Final Project

## Home Page Ideas

1. Add a full-page background image:
    1. Find a cool image on a site that offers free stock photos: maybe [stocksnap](https://stocksnap.io/) or [unsplash](https://unsplash.com/)
    1. Search for "Background Image" on this page [https://www.w3schools.com/css/css_background.asp](https://www.w3schools.com/css/css_background.asp) to refresh your memory on implementations
    1. **HINT** you'll probably need `background-attachment: fixed;` if it's not spanning the whole page!
    
1. Implement a typing background. Here are some examples:
    1. [Typing w/ Linear Gradient](https://codepen.io/EmmaJD/pen/rQBqQp)
    1. [Finish the sentence typing](https://codepen.io/Coding_Journey/pen/BEMgbX?&page=1)
    1. [Typing styled like the terminal](https://codepen.io/samarkandiy/pen/nyLsx)
    
    
1. Add a [parallax image](https://www.w3schools.com/howto/tryhow_css_parallax_demo.htm) to the background
    1. Find a cool image on a site that offers free stock photos: maybe [stocksnap](https://stocksnap.io/) or [unsplash](https://unsplash.com/)
