# Final Project

## Home Page Ideas

### Add a full-page background image:
    - Find a cool image on a site that offers free stock photos: maybe [stocksnap](https://stocksnap.io/) or [unsplash](https://unsplash.com/)
    - Search for "Background Image" on this page [https://www.w3schools.com/css/css_background.asp](https://www.w3schools.com/css/css_background.asp) to refresh your memory on implementations
    - *HINT* you'll probably need `background-attachment: fixed;` if it's not spanning the whole page!
    
### Implement a typing background. Here are some examples:
    - [Typing w/ Linear Gradient](https://codepen.io/EmmaJD/pen/rQBqQp)
    - [Finish the sentence typing](https://codepen.io/Coding_Journey/pen/BEMgbX?&page=1)
    - [Typing styled like the terminal](https://codepen.io/samarkandiy/pen/nyLsx)
    
### **Add a [parallax image](https://www.w3schools.com/howto/tryhow_css_parallax_demo.htm) to the background**
    - Find a cool image on a site that offers free stock photos: maybe [stocksnap](https://stocksnap.io/) or [unsplash](https://unsplash.com/)
    - Check out how to do it (here)[https://www.w3schools.com/howto/howto_css_parallax.asp]
